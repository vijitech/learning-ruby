## More about Ruby
-- It is a robust, dynamically typed, and object-oriented language

-- Nothing called as variable types, everything is a object

-- Ruby does not support method overloading as its a dynamically  typed language
    The most recent version of the method is considered while ignoring the previously defined versions of the method.
    
    class Test
    def self.sum(a,b)
        puts(a+b)
    end
    def self.sum(a,b,c)
        puts(a+b+c)
    end
      
    end
    Test.sum(1,2)
    We get error as sum (as per latest defintion) needs 3 argumment
